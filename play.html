        <h3>The Learned Woman </h3>
        <h4>Act I, The Act is in between ARMANDE, HENRIETTE</h4>
        <p> <h6>HEN.</h6><p> Yes, sister.</p>

            <h6>ARM.</h6><p> Ah! Who can bear that "yes"? Can anyone hear it without feelings
            of disgust?</p>
            
            <h6>HEN.</h6><p> What is there in marriage which can oblige you, sister, to....</p>
            
            <h6>ARM.</h6><p> Ah! Fie!</p>
            
            <h6>HEN.</h6><p> What?</p>
            
            <h6>ARM.</h6><p> Fie! I tell you. Can you not conceive what offence the very
            mention of such a word presents to the imagination, and what a
            repulsive image it offers to the thoughts? Do you not shudder before
            it? And can you bring yourself to accept all the consequences which
            this word implies?</p>
            
            <h6>HEN.</h6><p> When I consider all the consequences which this word implies, I
            only have offered to my thoughts a husband, children, and a home; and
            I see nothing in all this to defile the imagination, or to make one
            shudder.</p>
            
            <h6>ARM.</h6><p> O heavens! Can such ties have charms for you?</p>
