        <h3>The Learned Woman </h3>
        <h4>Act I, The Act is in between ARMANDE, HENRIETTE</h4>
        <p> HEN. Yes, sister.<br>

            ARM. Ah! Who can bear that "yes"? Can anyone hear it without feelings
            of disgust?<br>
            
            HEN. What is there in marriage which can oblige you, sister, to....<br>
            
            ARM. Ah! Fie!<br>
            
            HEN. What?<br>
            
            ARM. Fie! I tell you. Can you not conceive what offence the very
            mention of such a word presents to the imagination, and what a
            repulsive image it offers to the thoughts? Do you not shudder before
            it? And can you bring yourself to accept all the consequences which
            this word implies?<br>
            
            HEN. When I consider all the consequences which this word implies, I
            only have offered to my thoughts a husband, children, and a home; and
            I see nothing in all this to defile the imagination, or to make one
            shudder.<br>
            
            ARM. O heavens! Can such ties have charms for you?</p>
