            <h6 class="name">HEN.</h6><p class="speech HEN"> And what at my age can I do better than take a husband who loves me, and whom I love, 
            and through such a tender union secure the delights of an innocent life? If there be conformity of tastes, 
            do you see no attraction in such a bond?</p>

            <h6 class="name">ARM.</h6><p class="speech ARM"> Ah! heavens! What a grovelling disposition! What a poor part you act in the world, to confine
            yourself to family affairs, and to think of no more soul-stirring pleasures than those offered 
            by an idol of a husband and by brats of children! Leave these base pleasures to the low and vulgar. 
            Raise your thoughts to more exalted objects; endeavour to cultivate a taste for nobler pursuits; 
            and treating sense and matter with contempt, give yourself, as we do, wholly to the cultivation of 
            your mind. You have for an example our mother, who is everywhere honoured with the name of learned. 
            Try, as we do, to prove yourself her daughter; aspire to the enlightened intellectuality which
            is found in our family, and acquire a taste for the rapturous pleasures which the love of study 
            brings to the heart and mind. Instead of being in bondage to the will of a man, marry yourself,
            sister, to philosophy, for it alone raises you above the rest of mankind, gives sovereign empire 
            to reason, and submits to its laws the animal part, with those grovelling desires which lower us 
            to the level of the brute. These are the gentle flames, the sweet ties, which should fill every 
            moment of life. And the cares to which I see so many women given up, appear to me pitiable frivolities.</p>

            <h6 class="name">HEN.</h6><p class="speech HEN"> Heaven, whose will is supreme, forms us at our birth to fill different spheres; and it is not 
            every mind which is composed of materials fit to make a philosopher. If your mind is created to soar
            to those heights which are attained by the speculations of learned men, mine is fitted, sister, to 
            take a meaner flight and to centre its weakness on the petty cares of the world. Let us not interfere 
            with the just decrees of Heaven; but let each of us follow our different instincts. You, borne on the 
            wings of a great and noble genius, will inhabit the lofty regions of philosophy; I, remaining here below, will
            taste the terrestrial charms of matrimony. Thus, in our several paths, we shall still imitate our mother: you, 
            in her mind and its noble longings; I, in her grosser senses and coarser pleasures; you, in the
            productions of genius and light, and I, sister, in productions more material.
            ARM. When we wish to take a person for a model, it is the nobler side we should imitate; and it is not 
            taking our mother for a model, sister, to cough and spit like her.</p>
